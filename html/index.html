   <h3>How to use this document</h3>
   <p>
    A normal text is read from start to finish.
    Hypertext is different.
    It branches out and lets you go exploring.
    This thing is hypertext.
    Some of the links here go to things you'll need to understand before the rest will make sense.
    Other links might point to really detailed things that you won't care about until later.
    Those links, which I call "deep" links because they lead to deeper information, are colored differently.
    At the time of writing, deep links are black and look like
    <a href="./meta/hypertext.html" class="deep">this</a>.
    Don't click on a deep link unless you care about what it has to say.
